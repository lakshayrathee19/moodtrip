🌍 MoodTrip AI
🚀 Live Demo — https://moodtrip.streamlit.app/

MoodTrip AI is a prototype web application that suggests travel destinations, music playlists, and outfits based on a user’s mood, energy level, and budget. Whether you feel adventurous, relaxed, or ready to party, MoodTrip AI helps you plan a trip vibe — from where to go to what to wear and what to listen to along the way.

🚀 Features
Mood-based travel suggestions → Choose your mood and energy level to get destinations that match your vibe.

Budget filtering → Narrow down suggestions based on your spending comfort.

Activity highlights → See what you can do at each location.

Music playlists → Get curated Spotify-style playlist suggestions to match your trip mood.

Outfit recommendations → Receive outfit ideas suited for your destination and vibe.

Simple, interactive UI → Quick and fun to use, perfect for trip brainstorming.

🛠 How It Works
User selects mood, energy level, and budget.

The system fetches matching destinations from our prototype database.

Along with destinations, MoodTrip AI recommends a playlist and outfit to complete your travel vibe.

⚠ Known Limitations (Prototype Stage)
This project is not a fully automated travel planner yet — here’s why:

Subjective budget → We don’t know where the user lives, so trip costs are estimated roughly, which may not be accurate for all regions.

Limited database → Destinations, playlists, and outfits are from a small, manually curated dataset.

Static data → We’re not fetching live prices, availability, or real-time recommendations yet.

🧩 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Database: JSON-based static dataset (prototype)

📌 Roadmap
We plan to enhance MoodTrip AI by:

Expanding the database with more destinations, playlists, and outfit ideas.

Integrating real-time travel APIs for accurate prices and availability.

Improving budget estimation with location-based cost calculations.

Adding personalized itineraries, weather-based outfit suggestions, and live music playlist integration.
